% Implementation of the paper:
% "A simple and accurate face detection algorithm in complex background"
% by Yu-Tang Pai, Shanq-Jang Ruan, Mon-Chau Shie, Yi-Chi Liu

% Additions by me:
%  Minumum face size constraint
%  Adaptive theta thresholding (Theta is thresholded by mean2(theata)/4
%  Parameters are modified by to detect better. Please check the paper for
%  parameters they propose.
% Check the paper for more details.

% usage:
%  I=double(imread('c:\Data\girl1.jpg'));
%  detect_face(I);
% The function will display the bounding box if a face is found.

% Notes: This algorithm is very primitive and doesn't work in real life.
% The resaon why I implement is that I believe for low cost platforms
% people need such kind of algorithms. However this one doesn't perform so
% well in my opinion (if I implemented correctly)
